  <h1>Grilled Steak</h1>
  <img src="/users/garb/Desktop/repos/odin-recipes/img/steak.jpeg" alt="Well-grilled steak"> 
<p>Nothing gets your mouth watering faster than the smell and sound of steak searing on a hot grill.
  It's grill dinner, the best dinner you can have when you want meat, and lots of it. Get your bib on; it's eating time.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Grocery meat - the finest steak you can afford</li>
  <li>2 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespoon fresh ground pepper</li>
  <li>Olive Oil - as much as you need to coat your meats</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>About 20 minutes before grilling, remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let sit.</li>
  <li>Heat your grill to high. Feel the heat on your face. This is America.</li>
  <li>Brush the steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. This is the only time it's okay to doing <strong>anything</strong> liberally.</li>
  <li>Place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred</li>
  <li>Turn the steaks over and continue to grill 3 to 5 minutes for medium-rare (an internal temperature of 135 degrees F), 5 to 7 minutes for medium (140 degrees F) or 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well (150 degrees F).</li>
  <li>
    Transfer the steaks to a cutting board or platter, tent loosely with foil and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
