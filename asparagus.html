<P>When you're hosting a grill dinner, you can't slap a steak on the grill and call it a day. 
  You need side dishes, or your guests will eat too much meat and sweat all over your newly upholstered 
  rattan chairs. No one wants that! </P>
  <p>You want to know what I serve my guests hungry guests whenever it's grill dinner time? Asparagus! 
    It's healthy, delicious, and the rank odor of their urine will remind them of my fantastic cooking for days.
